# Library Template using libGDX and Gradle 7.x

Change this to fit your library!

You'll want to edit gradle.properties to match your library's name, description, author, license, and so on.
You probably also want to edit build.gradle to match the projectName and group to what you want to use.

You should "Find in Files" and search for any places that use the word "template" in order to find anything
you will want to replace.
